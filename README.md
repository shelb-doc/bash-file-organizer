# Bash File Organizer

**Self-Initiated Learning Project â€“ Bash File Organizer Script**

## Project Overview

I designed and developed a Bash script to automate the organization of files within a specified directory based on their file types (e.g., images, documents, scripts). This project allowed me to enhance my Bash scripting skills, practice file manipulation, and apply problem-solving techniques to improve efficiency in managing local file systems.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Analyzed** the problem of cluttered directories with mixed file types, identifying a need for automation in file organization.
- **Developed** a file categorization system using Bash to organize files into appropriate subdirectories (e.g., `Images`, `Documents`, `Scripts`, `Videos`) based on their file extensions.
- **Created** and implemented custom Bash functions to:
  - Automatically create directories for each file type, ensuring no duplicate directory creation.
  - Identify and move files to the appropriate subdirectory using `mv` and a `case` structure to handle different file extensions.
- **Applied** error handling and conditional logic to validate user input, ensuring the script was only executed if the correct directory was provided.
- **Enhanced** efficiency and usability by adding user feedback during script execution (e.g., messages confirming files were moved).
- **Tested** the script across multiple file types and directory structures to ensure robustness.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Bash Scripting:** Mastery of fundamental scripting techniques, including file manipulation, loops, conditionals, and functions.
- **Automation:** Streamlined the manual process of file organization, improving productivity and reducing the need for manual intervention.
- **Problem-Solving:** Addressed real-world issues of file organization by developing a scalable solution that can be adapted to various file structures and types.
- **Attention to Detail:** Ensured that the script handled various edge cases (e.g., missing directories, unknown file types, and case-insensitive file extensions).

## Outcome

- The script reduced time manually organizing files and increased overall efficiency in managing local directories, resulting in better workspace organization.
- Gained a deeper understanding of file management systems and the benefits of using automation to solve repetitive tasks.
